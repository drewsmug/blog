			<h1>Polygamy</h1>
			<h2>Intro</h2>
			<hr />
			<p>
			Joseph Smith's practice of polygamy is disturbing and reprehensible.
			</p>
			<blockquote>
			<p>
			<b>Polygamy</b> is the practice of marrying multiple spouses.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Polygyny</b> is when a man is married to more than one wife at the same time.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Polyandry</b> is when a woman is married to more than one husband at the same time.
			</p>

			<h2>Doctrine</h2>

			<h3>Doctrine and Covenants 132</h3>
			<p>
			Rrecorded July 12, 1843 at Nauvoo Illinois.
			</P>

			<h4>Verse 41</h4>
			<blockquote>
			<p>
			And as ye have asked concerning adultery, verily, verily, I say unto you, if a man areceiveth a wife in the new and everlasting covenant, and if she be with another man, and I have not appointed unto her by the holy anointing, she hath committed adultery and shall be destroyed.
			</p>
			</blockquote>

			<h4>Verse 61</h4>
			<blockquote>
			<p>
			And again, as pertaining to the law of the priesthood—if any man espouse a virgin, and desire to espouse another, and the first give her consent, and if he espouse the second, and they are virgins, and have vowed to no other man, then is he justified; he cannot commit adultery for they are given unto him; for he cannot commit adultery with that that belongeth unto him and to no one else.
			</p>
			</blockquote>

			<h4>Verse 63</h4>
			<blockquote>
			<p>
			But if one or either of the ten virgins, after she is espoused, shall be with another man, she has committed adultery, and shall be destroyed; for they are given unto him to multiply and replenish the earth, according to my commandment, and to fulfil the promise which was given by my Father before the foundation of the world, and for their exaltation in the eternal worlds, that they may bear the souls of men; for herein is the work of my Father continued, that he may be glorified.
			</p>
			</blockquote>

			<h3>Summary of Thoughts</h3>
			<ul>
			<li>
			If a women is with another man, she hath committed acultery and will be destroyed
			</li>
			<li>
			The women must be a virgin
			</li>
			<li>
			The only requirement is for a man to desire to espouse another virgin
			</li>
			<li>
			They are given to mutliple and replenish the earth
			</li>
			<li>
			Who are they given by? Does the women (or girl) not have a choice?
			</li>
